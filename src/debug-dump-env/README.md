### Dumping the environment during install

#### Why is this feature useful?

Each installation routine of a devcontainer feature is isolated. You might be interested what environment variables are set during installation.

This feature dumps its own environment variables to `/tmp/debug-dump-env`.

This is a debugging feature for feature developers.
